# myHelloWorld
My first repo on Github
This repo is intended to be private and just a learning ground to ramp up on the basics of Github

Use the edit branch to implement new stuff and then merge back to main.

This is an attempt to try out some markdown:

# This is my title
Want to try a main title and then a set of sub-titles

## This is my first subtitle
How about I paste a [link to dotnet/corefx][corefx-github] here, just for kicks.

## This is my second subtitle
I think I'll try a bold **bulleted list** here: 
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

That's it!
